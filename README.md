# Traily Dev Challenge

## What Is This?
This is a 30 minutes developer challenge so we can verify that you have the required skills to work as a frontend developer for Traily. You are going to create an input field that will suggest locations as the user starts typing. Below you will find links to a Figma Template, an explanation of BEM, and the Transport API. You have to create the application according to these resources. Here we have created a template serving as a fundament to help you create the application.
